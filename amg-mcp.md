# AMG-MCP

> **Note:** This document describes the **remote MCP server endpoint** that is built into every Azure Managed Grafana instance. For the **self-hosted MCP server** that you can run locally, see [amg-mcp-local.md](https://github.com/Azure/azure-managed-grafana/blob/main/amg-mcp-local.md).

Every Azure Managed Grafana instance includes a built-in remote MCP server endpoint called AMG-MCP. The endpoint path is `https://<grafana-endpoint>/api/azure-mcp`, e.g. `https://my-grafana-d5ggtqegcr2safcp.wcus.grafana.azure.com/api/azure-mcp`. This allows tools and applications to interact programmatically with the Grafana instance using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The AMG-MCP endpoint is using the same authentication mechanism as the Grafana instance, supporting both Entra Id and Grafana service account token.
