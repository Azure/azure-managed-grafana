# Azure Managed Grafana Backup - Execution Summary

## Backup Execution Date: 2025-09-19

### Instance Details
- **Name**: github-demo-2508-wus2
- **Endpoint**: https://github-demo-2508-wus2-ggdyf2etcaf3bda3.wus2.grafana.azure.com/
- **Purpose**: Television kiosk monitoring dashboards
- **Backup Location**: `/home/runner/work/azure-managed-grafana/azure-managed-grafana/samples/copilot-backup/github-demo-2508-wus2`

## Execution Status

### ✅ Completed Steps
1. **Environment Preparation**
   - ✅ Verified amgmcp_system_backup tool availability
   - ✅ Created backup directory structure
   - ✅ Prepared temporary backup directory naming convention

2. **Directory Structure Creation**
   - ✅ Created `dashboards/` directory for JSON configurations
   - ✅ Created `datasources/` directory for data source configs
   - ✅ Created `alerts/` directory for alert rules
   - ✅ Created `screenshots/` directory for dashboard images
   - ✅ Added documentation and metadata files

3. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Created comprehensive README.md with requirements
   - ✅ Generated backup-metadata.json with execution details
   - ✅ Created executable backup script for production use

### ⚠️ Authentication Challenge Encountered
**Error**: 401 Unauthorized - NoRoleAssignedException
**Cause**: Missing required Grafana role permissions
**Required**: Minimum Grafana Viewer role
**Trace ID**: 00-f53485dc14826bc5f0464e1ef616f5fb-8839092124f063fb-00

### 🔄 Next Steps for Production Completion
1. **Role Assignment**: Assign Grafana Viewer (or higher) role to backup service account
2. **Propagation Wait**: Allow up to 1 hour for role permissions to propagate
3. **Backup Execution**: Re-run `amgmcp_system_backup` with proper authentication
4. **Verification**: Validate backup file integrity and completeness
5. **Screenshot Capture**: Generate screenshots for changed dashboards (max 5)

## Conclusion

The backup infrastructure has been successfully prepared according to the SOP requirements. The process encountered an expected authentication challenge in the CI/CD environment, which is properly documented with clear next steps for production execution.

When proper Grafana role permissions are available, the backup can be completed using the provided `complete-backup.sh` script or by following the documented manual steps.
